<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400/1a1a1a/5a5a5a?text=The+Entrance" alt="A dark, winding stone staircase disappearing into shadows." />

The air grows colder and heavier with each step down the winding stone staircase. The city's sounds fade, replaced by a profound, suffocating silence. Your single flashlight beam cuts through the inky blackness. The entrance is sealed behind you.

[[Go left, to the dark, waterlogged passage->Passage Left]]
[[Go right, through the crumbling archway->Archway Right]]

:: Passage Left
<<set $light to $light - 5>>

The passage narrows, forcing you to squeeze through. The walls are slick with moisture, and you hear a faint, metallic scraping sound ahead. A strange smell, like wet stone and ancient earth, fills your nose. You find yourself in a small antechamber. On a pedestal sits a rusty, ornate silver bell, humming with a barely perceptible vibration.

[[Take the bell->Hall of Whispers][$inventory.push("Silver Bell"); $silver_bell to true]]
[[Leave the bell alone and continue->Hall of Whispers]]

:: Hall of Whispers
<<set $light to $light - 10>>
<<set $sanity to $sanity - 10>>

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400/1a1a1a/5a5a5a?text=The+Hall+of+Whispers" alt="A long, shadowy hallway with strange symbols on the walls." />

The air vibrates with faint, incoherent whispers. They are not words, but a chorus of hissing and muttering that seems to come from all directions at once. You feel your mind straining to make sense of the sound. The whispers get louder.

<div class="whispers">"Find... us... help..."</div>

<<if $silver_bell is true>>
The whispers seem to momentarily quiet as you hold the bell. You feel a distinct pull towards a side chamber.
[[Follow the pull, holding the bell aloft->Ritual Chamber]]
<<else>>
The whispers grow louder, and you feel an overwhelming sense of dread.
[[Huddle in the corner, trying to block out the sound->Hallucination]]
<<endif>>

:: Hallucination
<<set $sanity to $sanity - 20>>
<<set $light to $light - 5>>

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400/1a1a1a/5a5a5a?text=The+Shadow+Figure" alt="A blurry, distorted image of a grotesque figure in the darkness." />

You see a brief flash of something scuttling in the shadows, a grotesque shape with too many limbs. It disappears the moment you focus on it. You can't be sure if it was real or just a trick of your failing mind.

Your sanity is now <<print $sanity>>%.

<<if $sanity <= 0>>
[[The darkness consumes you.->Sanity Ending]]
<<else>>
You stumble back, trying to regain your bearings. You need to get out of this place.
[[Keep moving, trying to find a way out->Archway Right]]
<<endif>>

:: Archway Right
<<set $light to $light - 5>>

You pass through the crumbling archway and enter a large, open area. There are three paths ahead:

A path leading [[forward to a stone dais|Stone Dais]].
A passage to the [[left with glowing runes|Rune Passage]].
A small, dark hole in the wall to the [[right|Dark Hole]].

<<if $found_elena is false>>
You find a small, makeshift campsite. A woman, Elena, is huddled by a dying fire, her eyes wide with fear. She jumps at the sight of you.
"Thank God," she whispers, her voice hoarse. "I've been down here for days. There's... something here."
<<set $found_elena to true>>

[[Offer her a ration bar from your pack->Offer Food][$elena_trust += 10]]
[[Ask her what she knows about this place->Ask Questions]]
[[Tell her you'll find a way out, together->Team Up][$elena_trust += 5]]
<<else>>
You continue exploring the area.
<<if $elena_trust >= 10>>
Elena says, "I've found a small diary in the eastern chamber. It might be helpful."
[[Go to the Eastern Chamber with Elena->Eastern Chamber]]
<<else>>
You continue exploring alone.
[[Go to the Stone Dais->Stone Dais]]
[[Go to the Rune Passage->Rune Passage]]
[[Go to the Dark Hole->Dark Hole]]
<<endif>>
<<endif>>

:: Offer Food
<<set $light to $light - 2>>
<<if $elena_trust > 0>>
She gratefully accepts the food, her fear lessening slightly. "Thank you," she says. "It's been so long since I ate."
<<endif>>
She tells you she's a historian and came down here searching for ancient texts. She knows the layout better than you, but is too afraid to move.

[[Continue exploring the area->Continue Exploring]]

:: Ask Questions
<<set $light to $light - 2>>
"The whispers," she says, her voice trembling. "They call out to me. The entity... it feeds on fear. I think it's trying to trap us here forever."

[[Continue exploring the area->Continue Exploring]]

:: Team Up
<<set $light to $light - 2>>
"Together," she repeats, her face pale but her eyes determined. "I like the sound of that. I've found some things, but they're useless on their own." She gestures to her bag.

[[Continue exploring the area->Continue Exploring]]

:: Continue Exploring
You continue exploring alone.
[[Go to the Stone Dais->Stone Dais]]
[[Go to the Rune Passage->Rune Passage]]
[[Go to the Dark Hole->Dark Hole]]

:: Stone Dais
<<set $light to $light - 5>>
<<set $sanity to $sanity - 5>>

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400/1a1a1a/5a5a5a?text=The+Stone+Dais" alt="A stone dais in a ritual chamber, with a strange symbol etched into it." />

You arrive at a large stone dais in the center of the chamber. Etched into its surface is a complex, circular symbol. The air hums with a powerful energy.

<<if $inventory.includes("Cracked Amulet")>>
You feel the amulet vibrate in your hand. This is the place to mend it.
[[Place the amulet on the dais->Mend Amulet]]
<<else>>
You hear a soft click from the dais. A small, hidden compartment opens. Inside is a cracked amulet.
[[Take the cracked amulet->Take Amulet][$inventory.push("Cracked Amulet"); $cracked_amulet to true]]
<<endif>>

:: Mend Amulet
<<set $cracked_amulet to "mended">>
The amulet glows, the cracks sealing themselves with a warm, golden light. A calming sensation washes over you, and you feel your sanity improve.
<<set $sanity to $sanity + 10>>
You hear a distant scream.
[[Investigate the scream->Investigate Scream][$elena_trust -= 20]]
[[Leave the scream alone and move on->Archway Right]]

:: Investigate Scream
<<set $light to $light - 5>>
<<set $sanity to $sanity - 10>>
You find Elena, cowering behind a pillar. The whispers are louder here. She glares at you. "You abandoned me!"
<<set $elena_trust to $elena_trust - 20>>
[[Try to apologize->Apologize][$elena_trust += 10]]
[[Demand to know what she saw->Demand Answer][$elena_trust -= 10]]

:: Apologize
"I'm sorry," you say. "I heard the scream and came as fast as I could." Elena seems to calm down slightly. You've earned back a bit of her trust.
[[Continue exploring with Elena->Archway Right]]

:: Demand Answer
"What did you see?!" you demand, your voice sharp. Elena shrinks back. "I'm not telling you anything," she says, her trust in you completely shattered.
[[You part ways->Archway Right]]

:: Rune Passage
<<set $light to $light - 5>>

<img src="https://placehold.co/800x400/1a1a1a/5a5a5a?text=Glowing+Runes" alt="A passage with glowing runes pulsing on the walls." />

The walls of this passage are covered in glowing runes. They pulse with a low, rhythmic light. A strange, metallic device is embedded in the wall at the end of the passage.

<<if $puzzle_solved is true>>
The device is now a portal, glowing with an otherworldly light.
[[Step through the portal->Final Confrontation]]
<<else>>
A puzzle! The runes are glowing in a specific order: red, blue, green.
[[Press the runes in order: red, blue, green->Solve Puzzle]]
[[Press the runes in a random order->Random Press]]
<<endif>>

:: Solve Puzzle
<<set $puzzle_solved to true>>
The device whirs to life, and the runes glow brighter. A small, stone carved rune is ejected from the machine.
[[Take the carved rune->Take Rune][$inventory.push("Carved Rune"); $carved_rune to true]]

:: Take Rune
<<set $inventory.push("Carved Rune")>>
<<set $carved_rune to true>>
[[Return to the Archway->Archway Right]]

:: Random Press
<<set $sanity to $sanity - 20>>
<<set $light to $light - 10>>
A piercing alarm blares, and the runes flash violently before returning to normal. You feel a surge of panic and lose some sanity.
[[Return to the Archway->Archway Right]]

:: Dark Hole
<<set $light to $light - 10>>

You squeeze into the dark hole. The space is tight, and you feel ancient, mummified hands brush against your face. You reach the end and find a small, leather-bound diary.

[[Take the diary and read it->Read Diary][$inventory.push("Diary"); $read_diary to true]]
[[Leave the diary and go back->Archway Right]]

:: Read Diary
The diary details the great-aunt's rituals. The last entry reads, "The three totems—Bell, Amulet, Rune—must be placed in the central chamber to break the bond. But beware the price..."

[[Go back with the new knowledge->Archway Right]]

:: Ritual Chamber
<<set $light to $light - 10>>
<<if $silver_bell is true>>
You stand in a circular room. In the center is a pedestal with a hollow. The hum from the bell grows louder here.
[[Place the bell on the pedestal->Place Bell]]
<<else>>
You have no bell. The whispers are deafening. You flee.
[[Run back to the Hall of Whispers->Hall of Whispers]]
<<endif>>

:: Place Bell
<<set $silver_bell to "placed">>
The bell glows with a brilliant, silver light. A section of the wall crumbles, revealing a hidden passage. You've found the way to the final chamber.

[[Proceed to the Final Confrontation->Final Confrontation]]

:: Final Confrontation
<<set $light to $light - 10>>
